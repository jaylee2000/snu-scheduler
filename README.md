# SNU Scheduler

Welcome to SNU Scheduler!  
SNU Scheduler is a project aiming to automate the process of generating a schedule.  
For now, we have got the very basics.  
You can add several subjects you would like to take.

The input should be like:

-   Subject Name: Math 101
-   Monday Time: 3-4, 5-6, 7-8 (Any regular expression that goes like [Number, Other Characters, Number] as one set for each interval.)
-   Tuesday Time:
-   Wednesday Time: 4-5
-   Thursday Time:
-   Friday Time:
-   Weight: 7 (This value must be between 1 and 10)

Then, we take all of your subjects and generate the top 6 schedules that maximize weight sum.

The values for time are stored like

-   Monday Time: 3,4,5,6,7,8  
    We don't provide a neat frontend yet.
